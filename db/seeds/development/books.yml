      Iâ€™ll be straight with you. I want you to cry. To weep. To whimper sweetly. This book is a poignant guide to Ruby.
      That means code so beautiful that tears are shed. That means gallant tales and somber truths that have you waking

      tools such as computers to effect our desired changes.
